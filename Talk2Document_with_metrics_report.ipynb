        "\n",
        "Gemini is a family of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind that is designed for multimodal use cases. The Gemini API gives you access to the Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision and Gemini 1.0 Pro models.\n",

        "### Comparing text-based and multimodal RAG\n",
        "\n",
        "Multimodal RAG offers several advantages over text-based RAG:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Enhanced knowledge access:** Multimodal RAG can access and process both textual and visual information, providing a richer and more comprehensive knowledge base for the LLM.\n",
        "2. **Improved reasoning capabilities:** By incorporating visual cues, multimodal RAG can make better informed inferences across different types of data modalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook shows you how to use multimodal RAG with Vertex AI Gemini API, [text embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/model-reference/text-embeddings) to build a question answering system for a PDF document.\n"

Prevention of Accidental\\nElectric Shocks\\nDuring the work disconnecting the existing transformer\\nfrom the cable heads, induced current from the adjacent\\noperating unit No. 9 was observed. As a result, Hitachi\\nconsidered countermeasures against electric shocks (see\\nFigure 8).\\nMeasures to reduce the induced current were taken by\\nconstructing a detour circuit when disconnecting the lead\\nwire between the existing transformer and the cable heads.\\nThe results of subsequent verification also confirmed the\\neffect of reducing the induced current by limiting the out-\\nput of unit No. 9. Therefore, when connecting the lead wire\\nbetween the new transformer and the cable heads, in addi-\\ntion to constructing the detour circuit, Hitachi asked the\\ncustomer to limit the output of unit No. 9, which further\\nreduced the induced current and made the work safe.\\n6. Conclusions\\nThis project to help solve the social problem of a power\\nsupply crunch was an invaluable experience for Hitachi, as\\nit looked beyond conventional frameworks to take the best\\nactions it could, while sharing with the customer infor-\\nmation about the risks and opportunities of shortening\\nprocesses. Hitachi made a significant contribution to power\\nsupply stabilization in Japan by rapidly restoring the unit\\nNo. 8 GSUT.\\nAcknowledgments\\nIn the work on the rapid restoration of the unit No. 8\\nGSUT at the Nakoso Power Station of Joban Joint Power\\nCo., Ltd., Hitachi received the support of Joban Joint Power\\nCo., Ltd. and many other stakeholders.

Since the dimensions varied greatly\\nfrom the existing part, areas such as the interfacing parts\\nand the lead wire were re-examined.\\n(3) Steel material of main unit tank\\nThe steel marine (SM) material of the existing unit is\\nno longer used, so the current steel structure (SS) material\\nwas studied instead.\\n4.1.2\\nDifferences between Initial Delivery and\\nPresent Time\\n(1) Main unit tank material transportation\\nA transportation compliance review showed that trans-\\nportation with the same dimensions as the existing unit\\nwould not be possible. This resulted in a plate-mounted\\nsplit structure for the main unit tank.\\n(2) Review of internal standards\\nTo prevent the overheating of bolts and other parts by\\nthe current circulating through locations such as the cable\\npocket, a conductor for current energization was added to\\nthe flange and the welding structure was changed.\\n4.1.3\\nMatching Interfaces with Existing Cable Heads\\nSince it was necessary to match the interfaces with the\\nexisting cable heads, the dimensions at the site were mea-\\nsured and the structure was changed to one with plenty of\\nallowance for adjustments, such as changing the bolt hole\\ndiameters and increasing the number of part divisions.\\n4.2\\nProposals for Future Preventive Maintenance\\nThe results of the investigation into the cause of the fail-\\nure of the unit No. 8 GSUT showed that a short circuit\\noccurred between taps. This was caused by overheating and\\ndamage of the contacts on the LTC main unit tank side, due\\nto aging. About 40 years had elapsed since this transformer\\nhad started operations and the number of LTC switches\\nwas about 120,000, which is approximately one quarter of\\nthe number of switches generally expected. From these\\nfacts, it was deduced that the failure was a phenomenon\\nmore likely to occur under the conditions of both \\\"signifi-\\ncant aging\\\" and a \\\"low LTC switching frequency.\\\" (When\\nsurface roughness and level differences between specific\\ncontacts progress due to use in a limited tap range and the\\nterminal position remains fixed, overheating occurs more\\neasily due to deterioration of contact energization, carbon\\nadhesion, and other factors.)\\nAs preventive maintenance for the future, in addition to\\nlifting inspections of the changeover switches on the regular\\nmaintenance menu, Hitachi added contactor inspections for\\nthe LTC segment (tap selection device, polarity switch) on\\nthe tank side of the transformer main unit in significantly\\naged equipment to the maintenance menu.\\n | 4.1.2 | Differences between Initial Delivery and Present Time |\\n| :---: | :---: |\\n| (1) | Main unit tank material transportation |\\n| (2) | Review of internal standards |\",\n          \" 68\\nReferences\\n1) Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE), Ministry\\nof Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), \\\"Measures for\\nElectricity Supply and Demand for FY2021 Winter\\\" (Oct.\\n2021) in Japanese, https://www.meti.go.jp/press/2021/10/2\\n0211027003/20211027003-1.pdf\\n2) ANRE, METI, \\\"Outlook and Measures for Electricity Supply\\nand Demand for FY2022\\\" (Jan. 2022) in Japanese, https://\\nwww.meti.go.jp/shingikai/enecho/denryoku_gas/\\ndenryoku_gas/pdf/044_04_00.pdf\\n3) Japan Atomic Energy Relations Organization (JAERO),\\n4)\\n\\\"Nuclear and Energy Drawings [1-2-07] Change in Electricity\\nGenerated and Received by Source\\\" in Japanese, https://\\nwww.ene100.jp/zumen/1-2-7\\nJ\\u00f5ban Joint Power Co., Ltd., \\\"Electricity Sales and\\nFuel Consumption\\\" in Japanese, http://www.\\njoban-power.co.jp/category/nakoso_power_plant/\\nelectricity_sales_and_fuel_consumption/\\nAuthors\\nHikaru Fujita\\nT&D Engineering Department, Transmission System\\nDivision, Transmission & Distribution Systems\\nDivision, Power Grids Business Unit, Hitachi, Ltd.\\nCurrent work and research: Engineering of substation\\nsystems for industry.\\nMasaru Kashiwakura\\nTransformer Department, T&D Engineering and\\nProduction Division, Transmission & Distribution\\nSystems Division, Power Grids Business Unit, Hitachi,\\nLtd.

Prevention of Accidental\\nElectric Shocks\\nDuring the work disconnecting the existing transformer\\nfrom the cable heads, induced current from the adjacent\\noperating unit No. 9 was observed. As a result, Hitachi\\nconsidered countermeasures against electric shocks (see\\nFigure 8).\\nMeasures to reduce the induced current were taken by\\nconstructing a detour circuit when disconnecting the lead\\nwire between the existing transformer and the cable heads.\\nThe results of subsequent verification also confirmed the\\neffect of reducing the induced current by limiting the out-\\nput of unit No. 9. Therefore, when connecting the lead wire\\nbetween the new transformer and the cable heads, in addi-\\ntion to constructing the detour circuit, Hitachi asked the\\ncustomer to limit the output of unit No. 9, which further\\nreduced the induced current and made the work safe.\\n6. Conclusions\\nThis project to help solve the social problem of a power\\nsupply crunch was an invaluable experience for Hitachi, as\\nit looked beyond conventional frameworks to take the best\\nactions it could, while sharing with the customer infor-\\nmation about the risks and opportunities of shortening\\nprocesses. Hitachi made a significant contribution to power\\nsupply stabilization in Japan by rapidly restoring the unit\\nNo. 8 GSUT.\\nAcknowledgments\\nIn the work on the rapid restoration of the unit No. 8\\nGSUT at the Nakoso Power Station of Joban Joint Power\\nCo., Ltd., Hitachi received the support of Joban Joint Power\\nCo., Ltd. and many other stakeholders.

Since the dimensions varied greatly\\nfrom the existing part, areas such as the interfacing parts\\nand the lead wire were re-examined.\\n(3) Steel material of main unit tank\\nThe steel marine (SM) material of the existing unit is\\nno longer used, so the current steel structure (SS) material\\nwas studied instead.\\n4.1.2\\nDifferences between Initial Delivery and\\nPresent Time\\n(1) Main unit tank material transportation\\nA transportation compliance review showed that trans-\\nportation with the same dimensions as the existing unit\\nwould not be possible. This resulted in a plate-mounted\\nsplit structure for the main unit tank.\\n(2) Review of internal standards\\nTo prevent the overheating of bolts and other parts by\\nthe current circulating through locations such as the cable\\npocket, a conductor for current energization was added to\\nthe flange and the welding structure was changed.\\n4.1.3\\nMatching Interfaces with Existing Cable Heads\\nSince it was necessary to match the interfaces with the\\nexisting cable heads, the dimensions at the site were mea-\\nsured and the structure was changed to one with plenty of\\nallowance for adjustments, such as changing the bolt hole\\ndiameters and increasing the number of part divisions.\\n4.2\\nProposals for Future Preventive Maintenance\\nThe results of the investigation into the cause of the fail-\\nure of the unit No. 8 GSUT showed that a short circuit\\noccurred between taps. This was caused by overheating and\\ndamage of the contacts on the LTC main unit tank side, due\\nto aging. About 40 years had elapsed since this transformer\\nhad started operations and the number of LTC switches\\nwas about 120,000, which is approximately one quarter of\\nthe number of switches generally expected. From these\\nfacts, it was deduced that the failure was a phenomenon\\nmore likely to occur under the conditions of both \\\"signifi-\\ncant aging\\\" and a \\\"low LTC switching frequency.\\\" (When\\nsurface roughness and level differences between specific\\ncontacts progress due to use in a limited tap range and the\\nterminal position remains fixed, overheating occurs more\\neasily due to deterioration of contact energization, carbon\\nadhesion, and other factors.)\\nAs preventive maintenance for the future, in addition to\\nlifting inspections of the changeover switches on the regular\\nmaintenance menu, Hitachi added contactor inspections for\\nthe LTC segment (tap selection device, polarity switch) on\\nthe tank side of the transformer main unit in significantly\\naged equipment to the maintenance menu.\\n | 4.1.2 | Differences between Initial Delivery and Present Time |\\n| :---: | :---: |\\n| (1) | Main unit tank material transportation |\\n| (2) | Review of internal standards |\",\n          \"68\\nReferences\\n1) Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE), Ministry\\nof Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), \\\"Measures for\\nElectricity Supply and Demand for FY2021 Winter\\\" (Oct.\\n2021) in Japanese, https://www.meti.go.jp/press/2021/10/2\\n0211027003/20211027003-1.pdf\\n2) ANRE, METI, \\\"Outlook and Measures for Electricity Supply\\nand Demand for FY2022\\\" (Jan. 2022) in Japanese, https://\\nwww.meti.go.jp/shingikai/enecho/denryoku_gas/\\ndenryoku_gas/pdf/044_04_00.pdf\\n3) Japan Atomic Energy Relations Organization (JAERO),\\n4)\\n\\\"Nuclear and Energy Drawings [1-2-07] Change in Electricity\\nGenerated and Received by Source\\\" in Japanese, https://\\nwww.ene100.jp/zumen/1-2-7\\nJ\\u00f5ban Joint Power Co., Ltd., \\\"Electricity Sales and\\nFuel Consumption\\\" in Japanese, http://www.\\njoban-power.co.jp/category/nakoso_power_plant/\\nelectricity_sales_and_fuel_consumption/\\nAuthors\\nHikaru Fujita\\nT&D Engineering Department, Transmission System\\nDivision, Transmission & Distribution Systems\\nDivision, Power Grids Business Unit, Hitachi, Ltd.\\nCurrent work and research: Engineering of substation\\nsystems for industry.\\nMasaru Kashiwakura\\nTransformer Department, T&D Engineering and\\nProduction Division, Transmission & Distribution\\nSystems Division, Power Grids Business Unit, Hitachi,\\nLtd.
