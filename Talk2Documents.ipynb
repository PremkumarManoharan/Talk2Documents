        "\n",
        "Gemini is a family of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind that is designed for multimodal use cases. The Gemini API gives you access to the Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision and Gemini 1.0 Pro models.\n",

        "### Comparing text-based and multimodal RAG\n",
        "\n",
        "Multimodal RAG offers several advantages over text-based RAG:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Enhanced knowledge access:** Multimodal RAG can access and process both textual and visual information, providing a richer and more comprehensive knowledge base for the LLM.\n",
        "2. **Improved reasoning capabilities:** By incorporating visual cues, multimodal RAG can make better informed inferences across different types of data modalities.\n",

Prevention of Accidental\\nElectric Shocks\\nDuring the work disconnecting the existing transformer\\nfrom the cable heads, induced current from the adjacent\\noperating unit No. 9 was observed. As a result, Hitachi\\nconsidered countermeasures against electric shocks (see\\nFigure 8).\\nMeasures to reduce the induced current were taken by\\nconstructing a detour circuit when disconnecting the lead\\nwire between the existing transformer and the cable heads.\\nThe results of subsequent verification also confirmed the\\neffect of reducing the induced current by limiting the out-\\nput of unit No. 9. Therefore, when connecting the lead wire\\nbetween the new transformer and the cable heads, in addi-\\ntion to constructing the detour circuit, Hitachi asked the\\ncustomer to limit the output of unit No. 9, which further\\nreduced the induced current and made the work safe.\\n6. Conclusions\\nThis project to help solve the social problem of a power\\nsupply crunch was an invaluable experience for Hitachi, as\\nit looked beyond conventional frameworks to take the best\\nactions it could, while sharing with the customer infor-\\nmation about the risks and opportunities of shortening\\nprocesses. Hitachi made a significant contribution to power\\nsupply stabilization in Japan by rapidly restoring the unit\\nNo. 8 GSUT.\\nAcknowledgments\\nIn the work on the rapid restoration of the unit No. 8\\nGSUT at the Nakoso Power Station of Joban Joint Power\\nCo., Ltd., Hitachi received the support of Joban Joint Power\\nCo., Ltd. and many other stakeholders.

Prevention of Accidental\\nElectric Shocks\\nDuring the work disconnecting the existing transformer\\nfrom the cable heads, induced current from the adjacent\\noperating unit No. 9 was observed. As a result, Hitachi\\nconsidered countermeasures against electric shocks (see\\nFigure 8).\\nMeasures to reduce the induced current were taken by\\nconstructing a detour circuit when disconnecting the lead\\nwire between the existing transformer and the cable heads.\\nThe results of subsequent verification also confirmed the\\neffect of reducing the induced current by limiting the out-\\nput of unit No. 9. Therefore, when connecting the lead wire\\nbetween the new transformer and the cable heads, in addi-\\ntion to constructing the detour circuit, Hitachi asked the\\ncustomer to limit the output of unit No. 9, which further\\nreduced the induced current and made the work safe.\\n6. Conclusions\\nThis project to help solve the social problem of a power\\nsupply crunch was an invaluable experience for Hitachi, as\\nit looked beyond conventional frameworks to take the best\\nactions it could, while sharing with the customer infor-\\nmation about the risks and opportunities of shortening\\nprocesses. Hitachi made a significant contribution to power\\nsupply stabilization in Japan by rapidly restoring the unit\\nNo. 8 GSUT.\\nAcknowledgments\\nIn the work on the rapid restoration of the unit No. 8\\nGSUT at the Nakoso Power Station of Joban Joint Power\\nCo., Ltd., Hitachi received the support of Joban Joint Power\\nCo., Ltd. and many other stakeholders.
